## Reflection: (<em> CSS Style sheet in `css/style.css`</em>)
1. I tried to utilize a hamburger navigation menu by using Javascript since we started going over ther basics.
    - Followed the tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg" target="_blank">Web Dev Simplified</a>
    - it was a fairly simple tutorial but I still have trouble understanding the javascript, especially the `() =>` in `toggleButton.addEventListener('click', () => {}`
      - According to w3schools it <em>allows shorter function syntax writing</em>. When would you use it? Why? ---> more research needed.
2. I Wanted to show a certain part of the background image for the form section.
    - Used `background-postition: center;` but it was not specific enough.
    - came accross a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.asp" target="_blank">Background Position Page </a> by w3schools:
      - Used `background-postition: left-center;` which was gave a better part of the background image to show.

## Flare:
1. Added a Hamburger menu via javascript (`javascript/script.js`)
2. Added hover transition and transform effects `line 136-140` in `css/style.css`
